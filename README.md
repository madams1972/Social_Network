# Social Network-API
# Description
This is a backend database built using mongoDB. This is the alternate option to using mySQL. Using mongoDB this application is ready to be paired with any front end technologly to build a fullstack application
# Installation
Make sure you have node.js installed on your machine. Once this repo is cloned run "npm i" in your integrated terminal and all the required dependancies should be downloaded.
# Usage
Run the "npm start" Command in your terminal and open up whatever application you prefer to test backend routes. I personally use insomnia because of school but postman works great as well

Upon looking at the routes and the models you can begin testing the routes in your application. Feel free to change the models as you desire and add whatever data you would like to be stored

As of right now these are the routes,

**/api/users**

**/api/thoughts**

**/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions**

You can find a walkthrough video here (https://vimeo.com/789909104) showing how to use the routes that I have built out
